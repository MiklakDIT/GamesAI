This will be a deathmatch. There will be a few types of spaceships each with a unique behaviour. They will spawn and attack in synchronisation with music. For example, heavy ships will attack when there is bass in the song. Units will shoot lazer rays during long notes in the song. The environment will be responsive to the melody of the song.

The user will be able to choose a song from their library. Every song will result in a different gameplay. Thus, it is hard to predict the exact timeline of the events.

Note that the project does not use Unity but openFrameworks and it's in C++. Building it will require an openFrameworks build.
